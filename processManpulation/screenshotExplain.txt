The screenshot shows how linux handles background jobs and process IDs

sleep 100=> creates a process that does nothing for 100 seconds and adding & to it (sleep 300 &) makes run in the background

The terminal print the job number 1 2 .. and also PID like 10132

jobs=> lists the background jobs

kill -STOP 10132=> forces the process with PID 10132 to pause and change its status

kill -CONT 10132=> Resumes the stopped process with PID 10132

kill 10132=> terminates the process with PID 10132
