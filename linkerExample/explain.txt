file1.c defines a function called hello() that prints hello from 
file1 and it cant run alone as it doesn't intialize the main function

file2.c calls the hello() defined in file1.c function in its main function

what happens is when running gcc file1.c file2.c -o outputFile the compiler links both object files togther to output one excecutable program
